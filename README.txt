I am fairly familiar with pygame so I used that to create a trivia game that starts you off at the welcoming screen and
asks for you to choose the difficulty and category. I didn't happen to finish the dropdown menus for choosing the
difficulty or category though. If you click on the 'Start Game' button then it takes you to the question screen. You are
given a question and 4 options. You then choose which option you believe to be correct. I didn't finish implementing the
questions and answers so I just have filler text here. I set it up to have 5 questions. When all questions are answered,
you are taken to the final screen where you are shown your final score and rank based on your score. You are given the
option to either play again or stop playing the game.

To install pygame type in the terminal 'pip install pygame'
To install pygame_widgets type in the terminal 'pip install pygame-widgets'

I pulled from the requests, pygame, and pygame_widget libraries.

If I had more time with this, I would finish my work on fetching the questions and and utilizing in the game itself. With
this I would then check to see if the selected answer was correct and update score if it was. I would also fix my

dropdown menus for both the difficulty and the category so the user could choose which they wanted.
